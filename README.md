**As the cardio vascular risk is increase year by year. from the given data we've to predict whether or not a person will have cardio vascular risk within 10 years.**

**We are gonna do some eda to visaulize the dataset and will fnd some insight from eda, check for missing value, distribution of the features, target feature is balanced or not. Capping outliers, Balacing the target feature by SMOTE**

**After EDA, feature engineering and feature selection we'll split the dataset into training and testing set. Then we'll train multiple classification models, Hyperparameter tunning, evaluating model on the basis of classification metrics.**

**Finalizing the metric and best model on the basis of selected metric.**

# ðŸ“‹ Problem Statement
**As the cardiovascular risk is increasing. No of patient will also increase but the no of doctors avlaible is not enough to scrutinize every report. Which is a huge problem.**
